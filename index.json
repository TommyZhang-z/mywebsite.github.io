If there are duplicates, that means there exists a number that satisfy the condition.\nSolution\nCreate an Array named S Iterate for i: 1 to n: Iterate for j: i to n: insert A[i] + A[j] to S, where i != to j Mergesort S Iterate S: if any of S[i] = S[i+1], then it exists nested for loop = \\(O(n^2)\\)\nmergesort S = \\(O(n^2 \\log_2 n^2)\\) = \\(O(2 * n^2 \\log_2 n)\\) = \\(O(n^2 log_2 n)\\)\niterate S = \\(O(n^2)\\)\nnested for loop + mergesort S + iterate S\n= \\(O(n^2) + O(n^2 log_2 n) + O(n^2)\\)\n= \\(O(n^2 log_2 n)\\)\n(b) # By using a hash table instead of an array, we would know if duplicate exists before inserting to the hash table. (Note that on average hashtable lookups and insertion only takes O(1), so we can claim that the two operations has \\(O(1)\\) expected time).\nSolution\nCreate an HashTable named S Iterate for i: 1 to n: Iterate for j: i to n: if A[i] + A[j] in S, it exists! insert A[i] + A[j] to S, where i != to j nested for loop = \\(O(n^2)\\)\ninsert to hash table = \\(O(1)\\)\nlookups for hash table = \\(O(1)\\)\ninsert and lookups are inside of the nested for loop, which makes the overall time complexity still being \\(O(n^2)\\)\nSECTION 2: SEARCHING ALGORITHMS # SECTION 3: SORTING ALGORITHMS # SECTION 4: TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS # ","date":"September 17, 2022","permalink":"/mywebsite.github.io/blogs/comp3121-problem-set-1/","section":"Blogs","summary":"SECTION 1: INTRODUCTORY PROBLEMS # Exercise 1 # Solving with brute force cost \\(O(n^n)\\) time.\nWhich is not what we want\u0026hellip;\n\\(S[1] = A[1] + A[2] + \u0026hellip; + A[n] \\Rightarrow O(n)\\)","title":"COMP3121 Problem Set 1"},{"content":"\rThis is a demo site built using HUGO and Blowfish .
